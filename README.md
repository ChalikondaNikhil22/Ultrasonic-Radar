# Ultrasonic-Radar
Context Radar was developed in secret during the world war II in
order to detect obstacles or any incoming threat. The term radar was
coined in 1940 by United States Military as an acronym for "Radio
Detection and Ranging". Using radio waves a radar detects any in-
coming threat or obstacle. The basic purpose of radar is monitoring
and security.
Objectives.The objective of this project is to design an affordable
and reliable Ultrasonic radar controlled by Arduino Uno which is pro-
grammed via IDE and examined on Matlab. Using certain predeter-
mined scenarios we test the accuracy of the Ultrasonic sensor exten-
sively.
Methods.The ultrasonic radar is programmed to monitor a certain
space and when the sensor detects an obstacle on itâ€™s path or threat
approaching it is programmed to alert the user through displaying it
on the map designed on Matlab.
Results. 24 strategic release planning models are found and mapped
in relation to each other, and a taxonomy of requirements selection
factors is constructed.
Conclusions. We conclude that many models are related to each
other and use similar techniques to address the release planning prob-
lem. We also conclude that several requirement selection factors are
covered in the different models, but that many methods fail to ad-
dress factors such as stakeholder value or internal value. Moreover,
we conclude that there is a need for further empirical validation of the
models in full scale industry trials.
